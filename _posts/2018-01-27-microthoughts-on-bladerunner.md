Just saw *Bladerunner 2049* finally. While I went in with a biased eye to the sequel, I consider it a good film, if not worthy of exactly the same praise the original had. While I felt it didn't carry a lot of the same philosophical ideas as the original, and was blunter about it's themes, the cinematography was amazing. And just a rehash of the original would be boring. It feels like its own original film set in the Bladerunner universe,with the ideas and lore expanded on. Would recommend. 

I just finished the film seconds ago, so I will update later if any thoughts spring to mind.
