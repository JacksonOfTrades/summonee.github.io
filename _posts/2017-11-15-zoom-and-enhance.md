["Zoom and enhance" may actually be a real concept soon, instead of a movie groan](https://www.subtraction.com/2017/11/14/dumb-movies-may-turn-out-to-be-right-about-photo-enhancement/):

> For years we’ve groaned every time a character in a movie commands a computer to “Enhance!” a low resolution image, and then watched as an implausibly clear, high resolution replacement appears before our eyes. For me, this has always been one of the worst kinds of lazy storytelling; it always suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of how digital imaging works on the part of the moviemakers.

> Well as it turns out, the work of scientists over at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany may ultimately give technologically clueless film directors from the 1980s and 1990s the last laugh.
