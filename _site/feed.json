A VentureBeat story from early 2009 said that Zynga was making at least $50 million per year, mostly from sales of virtual goods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

For me, this has always been one of the worst kinds of lazy storytelling; it always suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of how digital imaging works on the part of the moviemakers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Well as it turns out, the work of scientists over at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems in Germany may ultimately give technologically clueless film directors from the 1980s and 1990s the last laugh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n",
